    <h4 id="west"> The Lakers are members of the Western Conference. There are 14 other teams in this conference and the Lakers are in the pacific dicision. The Lakers have tied the most NBA finals wins with the Celtics at 17! The pacific division includes the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Clippers, the Phoenix Suns and the Sacramento Kings. The teamâ€™s colors are yellow and purple, which can be seen in their jerseys, home court, and merchandise. Their coach was recently changed, as they officially hired Darvin Ham to replace Frank Vogel in that role. Ham was a former NBA player who had served as the Bucks top assistant since 2018, and won a title with them in 2021. Another change that happened recently was the change in name of the place where they play home games, from Staples Center to Crypto.com Arena. The location of the arena did not change, but the 700 million dollar deal caused the renaming. </h4>
