# CS50W-2020-project3
3rd Project of the Web Development Specialization Course from Harvard, Mail. An email client mainly implemented using Vanilla JS and fetching shit from the API provided.

Made on top of Django. I am sorry if the code seems spaghetti, but try reading it once, it won't be that tough. I hope this helps for references if you are stuck somewhere :)
An introduction to DOM Manipulation using Vanilla JS and creating single-page-web-apps aka - an interface.
In case you are interested in the problem and think you can solve it in a better manner (which is very much possible), check it out here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/
