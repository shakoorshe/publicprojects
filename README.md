**These projects were made for bootcamps from Columbia University or courses like CS50. The bootcamp code is in columbiahackathon and the CS50 code is in the cs50 code. I also have some more python projects on https://trinket.io/library/trinkets. You won't have acess to this link unless i use my username and password to sign in in which then you'll be able to see my code projects**
