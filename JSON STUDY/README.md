# JSON-study

JSON stands for Javascript object notation and I will place all code in here. JSON is a Data Representation Format and similar to YAML & XML.
It's commonly used for APIs and configs. 
It's lightweight and easy to read and write.
Integrates easily with most languages.

JSON TYPES:
- Strings
- Integers
- Booleans
- null
- Arrays
- Objects(these are key value pairs. For example an object would be something along the lines of {"age" : 30})
